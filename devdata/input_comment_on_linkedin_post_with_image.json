It shows that with a bit of ingenuity, one can replace a paid control room with existing CI/CD infrastructure and still get features like work item queues, parallel execution, and failure isolation. For DevOps and automation engineers, this approach offers a compelling alternative: use familiar tools (git, YAML pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes) to run software robots at scale, and avoid getting locked into RPA-specific platforms. Ultimately, fetch-repos-bot illustrates the art of combining RPA and DevOps to achieve scalable automation on your own terms â€“ no proprietary control room required.",
